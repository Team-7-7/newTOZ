## Design Sensibility
![NES colors](public/assets/readme/NES_colors.png)
- When making custom graphics, use the 52-color original NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) pallete.
- Turn "Pixel mode" on, so the edges don't get blurred, and we have crisp pixels for that 1980s (and 1990s) look.
- Let Phaser do the animations!
